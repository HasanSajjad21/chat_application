This is my Networking(CSE-312) project.I and my teammate Rezaul Karim worked together on this project. Java language is mainly used here.

Project Details:
 This project focuses on developing a feature-rich chat application using Java Swing and
 Socket Programming to ensure a smooth real-time communication experience. Inte
grating JDBC with a database (e.g., MySQL) guarantees secure storage of user data
 and chat history. Unique features include an efficient message search functionality for
 quick retrieval and an integrated calendar/event planner for enhanced user organization
 and scheduling within the application. This comprehensive solution provides a dynamic
 platform that not only facilitates communication but also empowers users with advanced
 search and scheduling capabilities
